# Multi-Process Support in Lind-Wasm

## Process Management

### Process Class
The Process class follows a threading-like API for managing processes:

```python
from multiprocess import Process, Queue

def worker(q):
    q.put('hello world')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    q = Queue()
    p = Process(target=worker, args=[q])
    p.start()
    print(q.get())
    p.join()
```

### Process Pool
Worker processes can be managed through a Pool class for parallel task execution:

```python
from multiprocess import Pool

def square(x): 
    return x*x

pool = Pool(4)  # Creates 4 worker processes
result = pool.map_async(square, range(10))
```

## Synchronization

### Primitives
- Locks
- Semaphores  
- Conditions
- Events
- Barriers

Example usage:
```python
from multiprocess import Condition

condition = Condition()
condition.acquire()
# Critical section code
condition.release()
```

## Inter-Process Communication

### Shared Objects
Objects can be shared between processes using:
- Pipes for direct process-to-process communication
- Multi-producer/multi-consumer queues
- Shared memory for simple data
- Manager process for complex objects

### Manager Interface
```python
from multiprocess import Manager

manager = Manager()
shared_list = manager.list(range(10))
shared_list.reverse()
```

## Process Isolation

Each process maintains:
- Independent memory space
- Separate file descriptors
- Distinct thread pools
- Isolated system resources

## Error Handling

Processes should implement:
- Exception handling
- Resource cleanup
- Graceful termination
- Status reporting

The multi-process system ensures proper isolation while maintaining POSIX-compliant behavior across all processes.
